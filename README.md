# Rimuru Tempest Mod

Rimuru is a form-changing character that alternates between utility and damage.

- His sword attack can dash towards enemies
- He has elemental interactions when an enemy is wet, shocked, or ignited
- Aim to switch between his forms to maximise his damage output
- Different enemies grant different passive buffs from Slime form's Devour

Network compatible.

Emote compatible.

Risk of options compatible.

## NOTE:
Mod was completed with what we envisioned now, thanks to the commissioner, LeapedGold. If you'd like to add more to it, create a fork and talk to me (Discord: ethanol10), and we can setup a release for this mod.

## Latest Changes

- v1.1.0
    - Added support for SotS
    - Fixed an issue where errors were spammed transitioning to a new stage with rimuru buffs.
- v1.0.0 
    - Devour now has **unique buffs for every monster in the base and expansion** (SotV). (Further new enemies may not be supported if created.)
        - We'll update a wiki page later with the list of skills.
    - Added some animation tweaks to sword swing.
    - After a dash attack, Rimuru will now spin and deal some damage, while moving slightly up.
    - Rimuru can now glide by holding the jump down while in the air.
    - Fixed some bugs, other fixes:
        - Center for Rimuru has now been properly set so effects are set around the center of the body rather than the feet.
        - Eclipse progress should naturally work now without other mods. 
        - Slightly optimized the sound sizes.
        - Added some options into RoO
        - Devour used to not work with other DoTs as they would take precedence and not give a buff. This was fixed to ensure that devour always get registered and should only grant buffs when you are in slime mode.
