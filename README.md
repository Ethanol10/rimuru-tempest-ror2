# Rimuru Tempest Mod

Rimuru is a form-changing character that alternates between utility and damage.

- His sword attack can dash towards enemies
- He has elemental interactions when an enemy is wet, shocked, or ignited
- Aim to switch between his forms to maximise his damage output
- Different enemies grant different passive buffs from Slime form's Devour

Network compatible.

Emote compatible.

Risk of options compatible.

## NOTE:
Mod was completed with what we envisioned now, thanks to the commissioner, LeapedGold. If you'd like to add more to it, create a fork and talk to me (Discord: ethanol10), and we can setup a release for this mod.
