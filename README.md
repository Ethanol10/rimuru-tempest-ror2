# Rimuru Tempest Mod

Rimuru is a form-changing character that alternates between utility and damage.

- His sword attack can dash towards enemies
- He has elemental interactions when an enemy is wet, shocked, or ignited
- Aim to switch between his forms to maximise his damage output
- Different enemies grant different passive buffs from Slime form's Devour

Network compatible.

Emote compatible.

Risk of options compatible.

## NOTE:
This mod is not polished well and will most likely not be finished. This is due to the commissioner having financial issues and it'd be a waste to not release what we got. 

I've noticed many people are unsure of what is required for this mod to be classified as finished, this would require an animation overhaul, as well as implementing a system where each enemy devoured would have a unique effect. Currently this is not in development and I am not an animator, so simply paying me to do animations is not a solution ("I mean, have you seen my animations? They look like trash!" - Ethanol 10)

## Latest Changes

- v0.9.4 -> Added Risk of options support for damage coefficients and other properties on each move, some options need a restart to apply. Text descriptions for options do not update until a restart, but if they are not cooldowns, they will be applied in the background.
